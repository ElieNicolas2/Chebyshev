# Chebyshev Approximation Technique Design Repository

This repository contains Python code for software simulation/coefficient generation and SystemVerilog code for hardware implementation of the Chebyshev Approximation Technique Design algorithm.

## Overview

The Optimized Chebyshev Design algorithm is utilized for the design of digital filters, particularly to optimize passband and stopband ripple characteristics. This repository offers both hardware and software implementations of the algorithm, providing flexibility for various applications.

## Contents

1. **Software Simulations**
   - `chebyshev_design.py`: Python code for simulating the Optimized Chebyshev Design algorithm in software environment.
   - `chebyshev_design.c`: C code for simulating the Optimized Chebyshev Design algorithm in software environment.

2. **Hardware Implementation**
   - `chebyshev_design.sv`: SystemVerilog code implementing the Optimized Chebyshev Design algorithm for hardware implementation.

## Usage

### Software Simulations
To perform software simulations, ensure you have Python installed along with the necessary libraries (e.g., NumPy). Run `chebyshev_design.py` to execute the software simulation. Modify the script as needed to adjust parameters and analyze results.

### Hardware Implementation
To use the hardware implementation, you need a SystemVerilog compiler and a hardware description language (HDL) compatible toolchain. Simply include `chebyshev_design.sv` in your project and instantiate the module as required.
